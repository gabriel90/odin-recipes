    <h2>Barbecue Chicken</h2>
    <p>When it comes to grilled barbecue chicken, everyone wants a nice thick barbecue glaze attached to the skin, and the only way to do it is to brush it on as it cooks.</p>
    <p>But because barbecue sauce has such a high sugar content, it only takes a minute for it to go from brick red to solid black â€” so you have to be careful!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into halves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup barbecue sauce, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut 1/2-inch deep slashes in the skin-side of each chicken half: two cuts in each breast, two in each thigh, and one in each leg. Remove wing tips.</li>
        <li>Whisk vinegar, 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Place chicken in the bowl and turn to coat. Arrange chicken halves in the bottom of the bowl with the cut sides down; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels; discard any remaining marinade. Place chicken halves, skin-side up, on a plate and season with salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill until grill marks appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn chicken over, close the grill lid, and cook, basting with remaining barbecue sauce every 6 minutes, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
